This Power BI project presents a detailed sales analysis for Blinkit, Indiaâ€™s leading last-minute grocery delivery app.
The dashboard tracks key metrics such as Total Sales, Number of Items, Average Sales, Average Ratings, Outlet Size, and Outlet Location performance.
Interactive slicers, custom buttons (like a Refresh button), and an information icon linking to the Blinkit website enhance user experience.
The goal of this project is to provide business insights through clear, engaging, and dynamic visual storytelling.
